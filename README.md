# mario-recreated

## Introduction

The classic game, Mario, recreated (albeit using alternate royalty free sprites) in LUA with LÖVE.

This personal project demonstrates the capabilities to manipulate object velocity realistically in game design, and developing a procedurally generated map so that each playthrough is different from the last.

## Instructions

To run the game, simply download the repository and run the game from LÖVE. Ensure that the sprites and sound files are in the right directories to ensure that they can be rendered correctly during playthrough.
